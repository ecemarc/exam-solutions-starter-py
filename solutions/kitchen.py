# QUESTION A
#
# Assuming the identifier, or "id" attribute, of each salad is and will always be unique,
# ... and assuming the order of salads may vary,
# ... "print" the name of the salad whose identifier is equal to 3 (i.e. "Waldorf"):

# QUESTION B
#
# Assuming the "price" attribute represents a saladâ€™s cost to the consumer,
# ... "print" the number of salads which are more expensive than ten dollars (i.e. 3):
